## Install the .NET SDK

If you do not have .NET SDK installed on your machine, you can install it by clicking on __Install .NET SDK__ or through the Visual Studio IDE (preferred method on Windows).

To verify it's installed, [create a new terminal](command:workbench.action.terminal.new) and try running the following command:

```
dotnet --version
```

You should see the version of the .NET SDK that you have installed.
