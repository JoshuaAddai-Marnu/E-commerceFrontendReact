## Launch your app

Open a XAML or C# file and hover over the language status bar icon (portrayed as curly braces __{ }__ in the bottom right corner of the IDE next to the language name). 

Ensure that the Startup Project is set to your new project and the Debug Target is set to your desired target. (Note: To launch your app on Android, you will need to first [configure your Android SDK](https://aka.ms/vscode/maui/howToConfigure).)

Click __Launch your .NET MAUI App__, use keyboard shortcut (F5), or click ‘Run and Debug’ from the Run and Debug View. Then, select __.NET MAUI__ as the configuration. 

Watch your app launch!
