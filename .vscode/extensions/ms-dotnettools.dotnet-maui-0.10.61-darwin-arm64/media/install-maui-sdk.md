## Install the .NET MAUI SDK

If you do not have .NET MAUI installed on your machine, you can install it by clicking on __Install .NET MAUI SDK__ and running `dotnet workload install maui` or through the Visual Studio IDE (preferred method on Windows).

If you're on a Mac, make sure you have also installed the latest version of [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/app/xcode/id497799835).

To verify it's installed, [open a terminal](command:workbench.action.terminal.new) and try running the following command:

```
dotnet workload list
```

You should see the `maui` workload ID listed alongside the installed version.
